# Transition-of-Landcovers(1970-2000)_SCRS
This project uses different machine learning methods to calculate probability of transitions from one land cover to others over different time steps. The model is trained for estimating transition of dominant land covers (Permafrost plateaus, Bog, Fen) in a discontinuous permafrost region in a NWT.
